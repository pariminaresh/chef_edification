### Notes for future reference

This repository is to hold up the basic work files that worked for me.

List of things you can find here:
- A utility based 'knife commands' implemented to fetch the Chef server container objects like environments.Basically to avoid execution of knife commands repeatedly on single type of server objects.
- kitchen template for setting up your private chef server on local vagrant machine for any PoC work.
- ACL knife basic work flow commands to enforce RBAC on chef server objects.
- Lots more coming up :)..like inspec example profile , chefpec complicated templates(I feel if yo want basic chefspec you can find everywhere.)
